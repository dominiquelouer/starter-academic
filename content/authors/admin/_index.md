I am currently a PhD student in Communication Sciences and Disorders at McGill University in Montréal, Canada. 

My main research interest is bilingualism, particularly how bilingual individuals produce and perceive both of their languages. I’m currently involved in projects investigating rhythm perception in bilinguals and bilingual speech perception. 

Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions relating to my research!
